> Every year around mid April Srilankans (Ceylon) celebrates the new year, with delicious sweets, lots of traditions and lots of awesome games passed by generation to generation.
> With the rise of e-gaming I thought of developing some traditional new year games to be played in a web browser, for an online new year festival that happened in 2021.
> Due to the social distancing, it had to be an online event and this online new year games have happened.
